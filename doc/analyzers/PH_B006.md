# PH_B006 - Non-Atomic Read/Write on Volatile Field

## Problem

The `volatile` prevents data races on the field. Although the accesses to these fields are thread-safe, operations such as `++`, `+=`, and similar are not atomic and lead therefore to race conditions.

## Solution

Use a proper atomic operation of the `System.Threading.Interlocked` class, such as `Interlocked.Increment(...)`.
