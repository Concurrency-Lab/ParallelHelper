# PH_S022 - Parallel.For with Monitor Synchronization

## Problem

The application of synchronization -such as monitor locks- inside a `Parallel.For(...)` statement neglects the parallelization benefits.

## Solution

Make use of the `localFinally` argument for aggregation functions and concentrate the synchronization in there.
