# PH_S012 - Task only returning value

## Problem

Creating and starting a new task using `Task.Factory.StartNew(...)` or `Task.Run(...)` that only returns an already computed value is pointless and unnecessary overhead.

## Solution

Replace the task creation with `Task.FromResult(...)` to create a completed task with the specified value.
