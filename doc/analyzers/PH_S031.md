# PH_S031 - Monitor.Wait Inside Async Method or Task

## Problem

`Monitor.Wait(...)` makes the current thread wait for a signal of another thread. Therefore, the waiting task depends on another, effectively blocking a thread of the TPL thread-pool. Although the TPL automatically increases the number of threads to meet a certain task throughput, it may negatively impact the overall application performance.

## Solution

Tasks should be independent units of work. A good rule of thumb is to evaluate if the algorithm would work with a thread-pool with just a single thread.
