# PH_S018 - Monitor.Pulse with multiple Monitor.Wait

## Problem

The invocation of `Monitor.Pulse(...)` can signal multiple different `Monitor.Wait(...)` statements. Since it is not possible to choose which `Monitor.Wait(...)` to signal exactly; it can lead to the signalization of the wrong one. This signaling problematic may even occur if the two or more `Monitor.Wait(...)` invocations are mutually exclusive, i.e., the condition of only one of the `Monitor.Wait(...)` invocations is satisfied at a time.

## Solution

Use one of the signaling methods thoroughly. When unsure which of the two is more suitable, always use `Monitor.PulseAll(...)` since it is never wrong in terms of correctness, unlike `Monitor.Pulse(...)` which is only correct when fulfilling specific properties.
