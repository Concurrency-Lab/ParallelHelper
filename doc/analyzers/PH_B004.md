# PH_B004 - Monitor.Wait is Enclosed By Parameter-Dependent While-Loop

## Problem

The invocation of `Monitor.Pulse(...)` notifies a `Monitor.Wait(...)` that is enclosed by a `while` loop that depends on a method parameter. Due to the parameter dependence of the `while` loop, there can be multiple threads with semantically different conditions. Because of the reason that it is not possible to signal a specific thread, it may lead to the signalization of the wrong one.

## Solution

Replace the invocation of `Monitor.Pulse(...)` with `Monitor.PulseAll(...)` to always signal all waiting threads.
