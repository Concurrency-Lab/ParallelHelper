# PH_B003 - Unsynchronized Collection Access

## Problem

On access to the collection occurs inside a `lock` statement while another does not. This constellation can lead to data races and race conditions when both accesses run concurrently. Moreover, even if the non-synchronized access is read-only, the problem persists.

## Solution

Enclose all collection accesses -even the read-only- with a `lock` statement.
