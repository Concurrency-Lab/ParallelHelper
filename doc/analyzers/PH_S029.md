# PH_S029 - ThreadLocal in Async Method

## Problem

Unless a synchronization context is used, the code after the `await` keyword (the continuation) is potentially run on a different thread than the code before it. Therefore, the two code sections may access different values of a `System.Threading.ThreadLocal`.

## Solution

Consider the use of `System.Threading.Tasks.AsyncLocal` to share data across an asynchronous flow.

## Additional Note

Mind that under some circumstances that the use of `ThreadLocal` in asynchronous methods is safe, such as using it to re-use an instance for computations and not sharing information. For example, consider an instance of the class `System.Random`. Encapsulating the instance inside a `ThreadLocal` allows the safe use across different asynchronous flows and the underlying threads, unless the same seed inside the asynchronous flow is desired.
