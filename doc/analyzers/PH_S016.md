# PH_S016 - Monitor.Pulse with multiple Monitor.Wait

## Problem

Multiple `Monitor.Wait` invocations access the same synchronization object. Therefore, the chance for multiple semantically different wait conditions is high.
If multiple threads are awaiting different states (i.e., semantically different wait conditions), chances are high that `Monitor.Pulse` signals the wrong thread.

## Solution

Replace the `Monitor.Pulse` invocation with `Monitor.PulseAll`.
