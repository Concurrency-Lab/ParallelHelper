# PH_B011 - Returning a Task based on a Disposed Value

## Problem

A task object is returned, although the enclosing `using` statement disposes the relevant object. This constellation can lead to the undesired disposal of the object during the execution of the task.

## Solution

Await the returned task to ensure that the object is only disposed after the completion of the asynchronous operation.
