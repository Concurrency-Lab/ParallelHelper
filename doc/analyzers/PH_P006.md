# PH_P006 - Discouraged Monitor Method

## Problem

The explicit use of the method `Monitor.Enter(object)` is discouraged. Moreover, the correct implementation of a fail-safe monitor-lock is cumbersome and requires unnecessary boilerplate code.

## Solution

Use the provided `lock` statement instead. This statement ensures correct acquisition and release of the lock.
