# PH_P004 - CancellationToken not Passed Through

## Problem

The current method receives a cancellation token that is not passed to the invoked method, although the callee or one of its overloads accept such a token. Cancellation tokens are meaningless if not used accordingly.

## Solution

Pass the received cancellation token to the invoked method. If the invoked method must not be canceled (e.g., for logging a failure), pass `CancellationToken.None` instead to explicitly state the intention.

## Options

```ini
# A white-space separated list of methods to exclude when searching for method invocations that miss the cancellation token
# Format: <type-specifier>:<method1>,<method2>
dotnet_diagnostic.PH_P007.exclusions = System.Threading.Tasks.Task:Run
```
