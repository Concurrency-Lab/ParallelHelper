# PH_P004 - CancellationToken not Passed Through

## Problem

The current method receives a cancellation token that is not passed to the invoked method, although the callee or one of its overloads accept such a token. Cancellation tokens are meaningless if not used accordingly.

## Solution

Pass the received cancellation token to the invoked method.
