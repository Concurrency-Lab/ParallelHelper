# PH_P005 - Missing Gate-Keeper

## Problem

When blockingly waiting for the completion of an asynchronous operation -e.g., with `Task.Wait()`,- it can block the execution of the enclosing synchronization context. This constellation can ultimately lead to the situation that the application becomes unresponsive.

```cs
var data = ReadAsync().Result;
```

## Solution

Enclose the call of the asynchronous method with `Task.Run(...)`. This setup ensures that there is no synchronization context in the call-chain that may block the continuation of the synchronization context.

```cs
var data = Task.Run(async () => await ReadAsync()).Result;
```

## Note

The gate-keeper is unnecessary when absolutely all `await` usages in the chain make use of `ConfigureAwait(false)`. However, if there is a single code-fragment missing this configuration, it can break the whole chain.
