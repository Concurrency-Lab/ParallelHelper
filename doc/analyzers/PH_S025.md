# PH_S025 - Unused Synchronous Task Result

## Problem

A synchronously computed value is returned with `Task.FromResult(...)`. Although, the method only returns a task without a value; thus, the value is unnecessary.

## Solution

Either change the return type of the method, so it returns the computed value. Alternatively, replace the use of `Task.FromResult(...)` with `Task.CompletedTask`.
