# PH_S032 - Throws in Potentially Async Method

## Problem

A method denotes itself as asynchronous by returning a `Task` and using the `Async` suffix. However, it does not use the `async` and `await` keywords but returns the tasks explicitly.
If such a *potentially async method* throws an exception inside its body, it behaves differently to methods using the `async` principles. The latter encapsulates the thrown exceptions inside the return task object. The former throws the exception upon invocation.

## Solution

Encapsulate the exceptions in a task using `Task.FromException(...)`.
