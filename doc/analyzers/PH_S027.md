# PH_S027 - Leaked Outbound Collection

## Problem

The access to a collection is protected synchronized with the help of monitor locks, but a reference is returned. The returned reference allows unprotected accesses to the collection, thus neglecting the synchronization effort.

## Solution

Return the reference of a copy of the collection instead of the original collection.
