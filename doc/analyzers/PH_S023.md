# PH_S023 - Monitor Lock in Async Method

## Problem

The use of blocking synchronization mechanisms inside asynchronous methods, such as monitor locks, is discouraged, because there are more suitable asynchronous alternatives.

## Solution

Do not use blocking synchronization primitives inside asynchronous methods. Prefer the use of the `WaitAsync(...)` of the `SemaphoreSlim` type.
