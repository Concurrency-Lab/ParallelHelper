# PH_P002 - Monitor.Wait without Conditional Loop

## Problem

The invocation of `Monitor.Wait(...)` is not enclosed by a `while` loop. However, code that uses this method usually waits for a particular state. It becomes more problematic when using it in conjunction with `Monitor.PulseAll(...)`. Since it is not possible to specify which thread to notify, it may notify threads that wait for a different state.

## Solution

Enclose the `Monitor.Wait(...)` invocation with a `while` loop that loops as long as the expected state has not been satisfied.

```cs
while(!isReady) {
    Monitor.Wait(syncObject);
}
```
