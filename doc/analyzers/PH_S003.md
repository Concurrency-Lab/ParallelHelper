# PH_S003 - SyncObject Change

## Problem

The change of the synchronization object inside an active synchronization can lead to undesirable effects. Another thread may enter a critical section before the active thread left its critical section.

## Solution

Do not change the synchronization object inside an active monitor synchronization. More generally speaking, it can usually be avoided to change the synchronization object at all.
