# PH_S006 - Unnecessarily Async Methods

## Problem

Only the last instruction of the method's body will run asynchronously. However, asynchronous methods capture the synchronization context when `ConfigureAwait(false)` is not used. Therefore, unnecessary boilerplate code is created.

## Solution

Remove the use of the `await` statement and get rid of the `async` method modifier and return the awaited task object directly.
