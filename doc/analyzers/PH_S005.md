# PH_S005 - Fake-Async Methods

## Problem

Methods that denote themselves as asynchronous (i.e., use the *Async* suffix), although they solely execute a task.

```cs
public Task DoWorkAsync() {
	return Task.Run(/* ... */);
}
```

## Solution

Do not use the *Async* suffix for methods that are not asynchronous. Even better, remove the enclosing task entirely and let the caller decide whether to execute the method inside a task or not.
