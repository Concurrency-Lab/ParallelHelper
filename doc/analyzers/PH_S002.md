# PH_S002 - Monitor Discouraged Sync Object

## Problem

The use of boxed types and strings as synchronization objects is discouraged. Their use may lead to unexpected effects during synchronization. For example, two unrelated objects may synchronize with each other because of the use of the same string literal.

## Solution

Use `new object()` for synchronization objects of monitors.
