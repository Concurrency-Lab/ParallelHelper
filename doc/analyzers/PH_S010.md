# PH_S010 - Parallel.For Side-Effects

## Problem

The use of `Parallel.For(...)` with side-effects in its body is discouraged. Moreover, even the correct use of synchronization primitives is questionable as it neglects the parallelization gains.

## Solution

Try to avoid side-effects in general. Make use of the `localFinally` argument for aggregation functions and concentrate the side-effects and necessary synchronization in there.
