# PH_P009 - Synchronous Dispose in Async Method

## Problem

The conventional `Dispose` of a `using` statement can be blocking. For example, this can happen if an output buffer was not flushed before disposal.

## Solution

The .NET Standard 2.1 introduced the `DisposeAsync` method as well as the `IAsyncDisposable` interface for asynchronous disposal. Prefix the `using` statement with `await` to invoke the asynchronous version.
