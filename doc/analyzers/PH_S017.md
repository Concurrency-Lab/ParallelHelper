# PH_S017 - Monitor.Pulse is used in combination with Monitor.PulseAll

## Problem

The combined use of `Monitor.Pulse(...)` and `Monitor.PulseAll(...)` is almost always an error.

## Solution

Use one of the signaling methods thoroughly.
When unsure which of the two is more suitable, always use `Monitor.PulseAll(...)` since it is never wrong in terms of correctness (when applying the best practice [PH_P002](PH_P002.md)), unlike `Monitor.Pulse(...)` which is only correct when fulfilling specific properties.
