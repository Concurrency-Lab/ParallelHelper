# PH_S011 - Invalid use of Non-Blocking Collection

## Problem

The code uses a non-blocking collection inside a loop that polls for new objects. This hot loop unnecessarily requires CPU time, although the use of `Thread.Sleep(...)` counters this.

## Solution

Since the loop actively has to wait for new items in it, use a blocking collection instead.
