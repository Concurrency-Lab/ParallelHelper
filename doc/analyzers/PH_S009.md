# PH_S009 - PLINQ Side-Effects

## Problem

The use of Parallel LINQ with side-effects in its body is discouraged. Moreover, even the correct use of synchronization primitives is questionable as it neglects the parallelization gains.

## Solution

Apply the aggregation in a LINQ operation without side-effects and use the result of the expression.

## Additional Note

The methods `AddAsync` and `AddRangeAsync` of entity framework's `DbSet` and `DbContext` are explicitely excluded from this analysis. The [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbcontext.addasync?view=efcore-5.0) recommends using the non-async versions instead.
