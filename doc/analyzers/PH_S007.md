# PH_S007 - Thread Start in Constructor

## Problem

Side-effects inside constructors and especially starting new threads and tasks should be avoided in general as it is unexpected behavior. Moreover, if the newly started thread accesses data of the constructed instance it can lead to data races.

## Solution

Create a factory method to instantiate the new object and start the respective thread.
