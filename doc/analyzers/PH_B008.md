# PH_B008 - LINQ To* Operation on ConcurrentDictionary

## Problem

Concurrent collections provide thread-safe operations. `ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>` implements the interface `IEnumerable<T>` which does not require the interactions to be thread-safe, although most operations are thread-safe since they make use of `GetEnumerator()`. However, methods such as `ToList()` are not thread-safe, even when used on thread-safe collections due to an optimized copy mechanism for types implementing the interface `ICollection<T>`, and introduce race conditions.

More critical is the fact that the concurrent collections often provide similarly called methods that are thread-safe. This constellation can lead to accidentally use LINQ method instead of the one of the collection.

## Solution

Do not directly use LINQ's extension methods like `ToList()`. Look for methods provided by the concurrent collection itself.

## Additional Note

The other concurrent collection types, such as `ConcurrentQueue<T>`, do not implement the interface `ICollection<T>` and are therefore not subject to the optimized copy mechanism.
