# PH_B008 - LINQ To* Operation on Concurrent Collection

## Problem

Concurrent collections provide thread-safe operations. These collections implement the interfaces of their non-concurrent counterparts (e.g., Dictionary and ConcurrentDictionary); thus, LINQ's extension methods can be used to interact with them. However, methods such as `Enumerable.ToList(...)` are not thread-safe, even when used on thread-safe collections, and can lead to race conditions.

More critical is the fact that the concurrent collections often provide similarly called methods that are thread-safe. This constellation can lead to accidentally use LINQ method instead of the one of the collection.

## Solution

Do not directly use LINQ's extension methods like `Enumerable.ToList(...)`. Look for methods provided by the concurrent collection itself.
