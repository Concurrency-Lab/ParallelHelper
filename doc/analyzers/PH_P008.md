# PH_P008 - Missing OperationCanceledException in Task

## Problem

The cancellation of tasks is a cooperative action. If an operation stops due to a cancellation and not completion, the consumer may falsely assume the successful completion.

## Solution

Always fire an `OperationCanceledException` -either explicitly or implicitly with `ThrowIfCancellationRequested`- to inform the consumers that the operation did not complete.
