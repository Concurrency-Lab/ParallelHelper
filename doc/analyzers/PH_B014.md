# PH_B014 - Await On Conditional Access

## Problem

A conditional access with `?` to a type member means that the value may be `null`. However, the conditional access result is asynchronously awaited using the `await` keyword, although `null` cannot be awaited and ends in a `System.NullReferenceException`.

## Solution

Guard the `await` using an if-statement or reconsider that possibility if this particular member can be `null`.
