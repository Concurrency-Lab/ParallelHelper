# PH_S014 - Task.Factory.StartNew with async delegate

## Problem

The method `Task.Factory.StartNew(...)` does not recognize `async` delegates. Therefore, the created task does not wait for the completion of the delegate. Last but not least, the invocation of the delegate will run in a fire-and-forget manner.

## Solution

Replace the task creation `Task.Factory.StartNew(...)` with `async` delegate aware `Task.Run(...)`.
