# PH_B015 - Disposed Task Instead of Value

## Problem

The expression of a using-statement represents a task holding a value that is `IDisposable`. However, since the task is not awaited, the task itself is disposed instead of the task's value. In general, it is not necessary to dispose a task; thus, it's most likely by accident.

## Solution

Await the task and dispose its value.
