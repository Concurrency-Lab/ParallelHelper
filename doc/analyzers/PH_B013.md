# PH_B013 - Null-Check Against Task Instead of Value

## Problem

Asynchronous methods usually do not return `null` in place of a task, especially if the method is defined using the `async` keyword. Therefore, a `null`-check against the returned task is unnecessary or resulted from a typo.

## Solution

Retrieve the value represented by the task by awaiting its completion using `await` and apply the `null`-check on the actual value.
