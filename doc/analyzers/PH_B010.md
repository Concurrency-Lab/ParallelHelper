# PH_B010 - Incomplete Monitor Synchronization on Single Field

## Problem

A single field is accessed multiple times inside a monitor lock. However, this field is also accessed outside of a monitor lock. Since there is at least one write-access, it incorporates the risk of a race condition.

## Solution

Enclose the block with a monitor lock.

## Options

```ini
# Report volatile fields: ignore (default) / report
dotnet_diagnostic.PH_B010.volatile = ignore
```
