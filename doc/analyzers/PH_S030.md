# PH_S030 - Async Void Method Invocation

## Problem

The primary use of `async` methods that return`void` is for event handlers. Asynchronous methods that return `void` have different error handling that is most-likely undesired at the current location.

## Solution

Replace the invoked method with an implementation that is awaitable, i.e., one that returns a `Task` object. If this leads to code duplication, extract the body of the `async void` method into an awaitable implementation and invoke the created method from within the `async void` one.
