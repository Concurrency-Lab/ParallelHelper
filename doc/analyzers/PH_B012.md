# PH_B012 - Multiple Awaits on the Same ValueTask

## Problem

The returned `ValueTask` of a method invocation is awaited multiple times. Awaiting the same `ValueTask` can be problematic since the class behind the invoked method may recycle the underlying task. Therefore, a `ValueTask` does not have the guarantee, as `Task` does, that it never transitions away from the completed state. 

## Solution

Make sure to `await` the returned `ValueTask` only once. However, it is best practice to `await` the method invocation rather than storing the returned `ValueTask` in a local variable. If both options are not possible, transform the `ValueTask` into a conventional `Task` with the help of the `AsTask` method (which may only be used once as well).
