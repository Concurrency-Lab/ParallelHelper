# PH_S019 - Blocking Method in Async Method

## Problem

An asynchronous method makes use of a blocking method, although there exists an asynchronous counterpart.

## Solution

Replace the blocking method with its asynchronous counterpart.

## Additional Note

The methods `AddAsync` and `AddRangeAsync` of entity framework's `DbSet` and `DbContext` are explicitely excluded from this analysis by default. The [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbcontext.addasync?view=efcore-5.0) recommends using the non-async versions instead.
