# PH_B005 - Monitor Signal Without Conditional Loop Effect

## Problem

The invocation of `Monitor.Pulse(...)` or `Monitor.PulseAll(...)` signals a `Monitor.Wait(...)` that is enclosed by a `while` loop. The `while` loop does not depend on a field that is modified by the signaling thread; thus will not be affected by the signaled change.

## Solution

Ensure that the signaling thread applies a change to the object's state.
