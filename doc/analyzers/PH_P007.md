# PH_P007 - Unused Cancellation Token

## Problem

One of the enclosing scopes holds a cancellation token. However, an invoked method does not receive this token although it or one of its overloads accept a cancellation token. Cancellation tokens are meaningless if not used accordingly.

## Solution

Pass the cancellation token of the enclosing scope to the invoked method.
