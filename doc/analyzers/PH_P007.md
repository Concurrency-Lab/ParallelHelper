# PH_P007 - Unused Cancellation Token

## Problem

One of the enclosing scopes holds a cancellation token. However, an invoked method does not receive this token although it or one of its overloads accept a cancellation token. Cancellation tokens are meaningless if not used accordingly.

## Solution

Pass the cancellation token of the enclosing scope to the invoked method. If the invoked method must not be canceled (e.g., for logging a failure), pass `CancellationToken.None` instead to explicitly state the intention.

## Options

```ini
# A white-space separated list of methods to exclude when searching for method invocations that miss the cancellation token
# Format: <type-specifier>:<method1>,<method2>
dotnet_diagnostic.PH_P007.exclusions = System.Threading.Tasks.Task:Run
```
