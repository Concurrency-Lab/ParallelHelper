# PH_B002 - Monitor.Wait inside Nested Locks

## Problem

The invocation of `Monitor.Wait(...)` is enclosed by at least two nested `lock` statements. Since the wait instruction will only release the lock on the specified object, the lock on the other object is not freed. This constellation may therefore lead to a deadlock.

## Solution

Do not make use of `Monitor.Wait(...)` inside nested locks.
