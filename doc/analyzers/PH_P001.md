# PH_P001 - Writeable SyncObject

## Problem

The field holding the monitor synchronization object is not marked `readonly`. Usually an instance uses the same synchronization object over its whole lifetime; thus marking it with the proper keyword is recommended.

## Solution

Mark the field with the synchronization object with the `readonly` modifier.
